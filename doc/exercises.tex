\item[Exercise 3.] Find a formula that converts position as given in (8) at time $t = 0$ into cartesian coordinates.

\blue{
In (8) we have access to latitude $\psi$ and longitude $\lambda$. We can calculate the cartesian coordinates by transforming from spherical coordinates as follows,
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
x &= \rho \, cos(\psi) cos(\lambda) \\ 
y &= \rho \, cos(\psi) sin(\lambda) \\
z &= \rho \, sin(\psi)
\end{aligned}
\end{polynomial}
}

\blue{
Where $\rho = (R + h)$, $\phi$ is the radian representation of our latitude $\psi$, and $\theta$ is the radian representation of our longitude $\lambda$.

x &= \rho \, cos(\psi) cos(\frac{2 \pi t}{s} + \lambda) \\ 
y &= \rho \, cos(\psi) sin(\frac{2 \pi t}{s} + \lambda) \\
z &= \rho \, sin(\psi)
\end{aligned}
\end{polynomial}
}

\item[Exercise 5.] Find a formula that converts a position given in cartesian coordinates at time $t = 0$ into a position of the form (8).

\blue{
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
\rho &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\ 
\psi &= asin(z / \rho)\\
\lambda &= atan (y / x) \\

\item[Exercise 8.] Given a point $\mathbf{x}$ on earth and a point $\mathbf{s}$ in space, both in cartesian coordinates, find a condition that tells you whether $\mathbf{s}$ as viewed from $\mathbf{x}$ is above the horizon.

% TODO need this in my program
Since the horizon line is going to be the orthogonal vector of a vehicle $\mathbf{v}$, we can project a satellite $\mathbf{s}$ onto our vehicle and determine where it's oriented around our vehicle.

\blue{
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{s}}{||\mathbf{v}||} &\ge ||\mathbf{v}|| \\
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{s} &\ge ||\mathbf{v}||^2
\end{aligned}
\end{polynomial}
}

\item[Exercise 9.] Discuss how to compute $t_S$ and $\mathbf{x}_S$.

% TODO clarify
\blue{
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}_s(t) &= (R + h) [ \mathbf{u} cos(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta) + \mathbf{v} sin(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta)] \\
F(t_s) &= t_V - \frac{|| x_s(t_s) - x_v}{c} - t_s = 0 \\
t_s &= t_V - \frac{|| x_s(t_s) - x_v||}{c}
\end{aligned}
\end{polynomial}

\item[Exercise 10.] Suppose you have data of the form from (11) from 4 satellites. Write down a set of four equations whose solutions are the position of the vehicle in cartesian coordinates, and $t_V$

% TODO need another equation
\blue{
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
|| x_V - x_{s_1} || - || x_V - x_{s_2} || + c(t_{s_2} - t_{s_1}) = 0 \\
|| x_V - x_{s_1} || - || x_V - x_{s_3} || + c(t_{s_3} - t_{s_1}) = 0 \\
|| x_V - x_{s_1} || - || x_V - x_{s_4} || + c(t_{s_4} - t_{s_1}) = 0 \\
t_V = t_s + \frac{|| x_s(t_s) - x_v||}{c}
\end{aligned}
\end{polynomial}
}

\item[Exercise 11.] Suppose you have data of the form (11) from more than 4 satellites. Write down a least squares problem whose solution the position of the vehicle in cartesian coordinates, and $t_V$.

\item[Exercise 12.] Find a formula for the \textit{ground track} of satellite 1, i.e. the position in geographic coordinates directly underneath the satellite on the surface of the earth, as a function of time. Do you notice anything particular? What is the significance of the orbital period being exactly one half sidereal day?

% TODO don't think I've thought of this one yet

\item[Exercise 13.] Find a precise description of Newton's method as it is applied to the nonlinear system obtained by processing data from 4 satellites, as derived in an earlier exercise. Your answer should include an explicit specification of the derivatives involved.

% TODO
\blue{
\begin{polynomial}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}_s(t) &= (R + h) [ \mathbf{u} cos(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta) + \mathbf{v} sin(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta)] \\
\mathbf{x}_s^\prime(t) &= (R + h) \left[ \frac{2 \pi}{p} \left( -\mathbf{u} sin(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta) + \mathbf{v} cos(\frac{2 \pi t}{p} + \theta) \right) \right] \\
\end{aligned}

\item[Exercise 14.] Similarly, find Newton's method for the nonlinear system obtained from the least squares approach. Again, your answer should include an explicit specification of the derivatives involved.

\item[Exercise 16.] I gave an early draft of this assignment to my friend Meg Ikkal Anna Liszt. After muttering about the federal deficit she said that she has been talking to the Air Force (who operate GPS) for years. She does not understand why they are being so hard on themselves. She could save them billions of dollars because to determine position and altitude you only need three satellites, not four! Three satellites would give you three components of position, once you know position you can compute true run time to the satellite, and from that you can compute the current time. She thinks that the Air Force is not implementing this approach because they don't want to pay her fee of 10\% of the savings in launch costs of satellites alone. What do you think of this?

\blue{
TODO
}


\item[Exercise 17.] After venting her frustration about the federal deficit Meg went to task with \textit{me}. She said that ``you academic types'' like to be so cumbersome. She thinks we don't use ``common sense'' because the very phrase isn't rooted in Latin or Greek. Why, she says, do I have to have integers \textbf{NS} and \textbf{EW} to indicate which hemisphere I'm on? Why, she says, don't I just make the degrees positive or negative? Indeed, why not?
